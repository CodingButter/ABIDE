# ABIDE Project Overview

## Introduction

ABIDE (Automated Basic IDE) is a cross-platform desktop IDE designed explicitly for integration with external Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The primary goal of ABIDE is to simulate a realistic, visually engaging coding experience, enhancing clarity and engagement during AI-driven coding demonstrations or educational streams. It is not directly integrated with any streaming platform but is optimized to be used seamlessly as a visual source within broadcasting software like OBS.

## Goals

- **Realistic Simulation:** Provide an authentic coding experience through animated typing, cursor movements, and visual file manipulations.
- **Robust MCP Integration:** Facilitate seamless communication with external LLMs via a secure and efficient MCP-based API.
- **Visual Clarity:** Create an interactive and intuitive interface emphasizing visual feedback and smooth animations.
- **Performance Efficiency:** Ensure high responsiveness and minimal resource usage, suitable for modest hardware.
- **Security and Isolation:** Offer a safe environment with a sandboxed execution and a virtual file system.
- **Modular Design:** Structured to facilitate easy integration of new features and extensibility.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Tauri v2:** Lightweight desktop app framework with native webviews.
- **Rust (Axum + Tokio):** Backend server providing secure, fast, and concurrent API handling.

### Frontend

- **React (TypeScript):** Efficient, state-managed UI components.
- **Monaco Editor:** Industry-standard coding environment with rich editing features.

### File System

- **Virtual File System (VFS):** Secure, isolated file operations without direct OS interaction.

## Simplified Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

- Setup Tauri with React and Rust.
- Configure security settings and sandboxing.
- Implement Virtual File System (VFS).

### Phase 2: Core User Interface

- Integrate Monaco Editor with multi-file editing.
- Implement intuitive file explorer.
- Develop a responsive preview panel.

### Phase 3: Simulation Engine

- Realistic typing animations and cursor movements.
- User-configurable animation speed and realism.

### Phase 4: MCP & API

- Build robust backend API with Rust (Axum + Tokio).
- Facilitate real-time communication via WebSocket.
- Ensure comprehensive validation and error handling.

### Phase 5: Optimization & Testing

- Extensive performance optimization.
- Cross-platform compatibility tests.
- Detailed user and developer documentation.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional programming language support.
- Terminal emulation.
- Interactive session playback.

## Success Metrics

- Smooth, responsive UI animations.
- Easy, secure MCP integration.
- Effective use within streaming platforms like OBS.
