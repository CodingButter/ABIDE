# ABIDE Final Development Plan

## Project Overview

**ABIDE (Automated Basic IDE)** is a desktop IDE designed specifically for external Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It simulates a realistic coding environment with animated typing, cursor movements, incremental file operations, and real-time code previews. While optimized to be visually engaging during live coding sessions, ABIDE itself remains platform-agnostic, acting simply as a high-quality IDE that can be captured as a source within broadcasting software like OBS.

## Core Objectives

- **Realistic Input Simulation:** Human-like typing and cursor movements.
- **Seamless MCP Integration:** Robust API to communicate with external LLMs via MCP.
- **Visual Engagement:** Animated interactions without direct streaming integration.
- **Security and Isolation:** Virtual file system and sandboxed execution.
- **Performance:** Lightweight and efficient to run smoothly on modest hardware.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design for future enhancements and easy integration.

## Tech Stack

### Desktop Framework: **Tauri v2**

- Lightweight, performant, native webview.
- Secure by design, fast startup times.
- Rust backend for safety and efficiency.

### Frontend Framework: **React (TypeScript)**

- Robust state management.
- Rich, modern UI components.

### Editor: **Monaco Editor**

- Industry-standard, powerful editor.

### Backend: **Rust (Axum + Tokio)**

- Secure, fast, concurrent backend services.

### File System: **Virtual FS (default)**

- Safe file operations without risk.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Security (Week 1)

- Scaffold Tauri & React app.
- Configure security settings (CSP, isolation).
- Setup Virtual File System (VFS).

### Phase 2: Core UI Components (Weeks 2-3)

- Integrate Monaco editor with multi-tab support.
- File explorer with navigation and management.
- Real-time preview panel integration.
- Responsive and flexible layout.

### Phase 3: Input Simulation Engine (Weeks 4-5)

- Animated cursor movements and clicks.
- Realistic keyboard typing animations.
- Configurable animation speeds and variations.

### Phase 4: MCP & API Integration (Weeks 6-7)

- Implement Rust backend API using MCP.
- Real-time updates using WebSocket.
- Command validation and error handling.
- Provide example MCP client.

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Week 8)

- Unit & integration testing.
- Performance optimization and profiling.
